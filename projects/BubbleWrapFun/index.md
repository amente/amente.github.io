I worked on this while I was teaching myself the Android Platform and API's.
I am no longer working on this, But all BubbleWrapFun code is open source and can be found on <a href='https://github.com/amente/BubbleWrapFun'>Github </a>.

One day I read an article <a href='http://www.npr.org/blogs/krulwich/2012/12/06/166685434/what-to-do-when-the-bus-doesn-t-come-and-you-want-to-scream-an-experiment'>here</a>
about a train company which managed to reduce customer complaints about waiting
times by using an ingenious solution. The solution involved providing customers
with different sizes of bubble wraps to pop while they are waiting for their ride to arrive.
This simple psychological solution seemed to work fine.

After reading the suggestion in the same article which mentioned few bubble wrap Apps ,
I decided to try them. My experience was rather disappointing, all of them had tons of adds
and some had unsatisfying user interface. None of them felt something that I can happily open when I am stressed waiting for my bus or train to arrive.
So I decided to try develop my own. And the project BubbleWrapFun was born."
