I learned Amateur Radio from the most incredible person that I met in my life, Mr.May.
Mr.May (ET3SID), a respected Scottish Electrical Engineer was a great person
who was always happy to teach anything to anyone. And, I was very eager to learn.

Working closely with Mr.May,I participated in building the ham radio station ET3AA.
I gained hands on skills in Soldering PCB's,tracking satellites,
building electrical installation and firefighting system repair.
I also had the chance to represent the Ethiopian Amateur Radio Society
at the International Amateur Radio Union Region 1 conference held in SunCity SouthAfrica,
which enabled me to network with many Amateur Radio enthusiasts from Europe and Africa.
