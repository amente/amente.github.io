details: "As part of the 2012 CanSat team from Carleton University, I was involved in coding the ground station software, debugging the overall system and the lunch procedure which happened in Texas USA."

experience: "The CanSat competition project enabled me to learn a lot of things , including inter chip communication protocols, Microcontroller programming and systems architecture. The multifacet nature of the project enabled me to closely work with and learn from students who are studying Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering ,Electrical Engineering and Software Engineering. I am currently leading the 2014 CanSat team"
motivation: " The <a href='http://www.cansatcompetition.com/Main.html'>CanSat Competition </a> is organized annually by the American Aeronautics and Astronautics Society with featuring sponsors such as NASA and brings university teams from all over the world to participate by designing, building and launching a can sized satellite like system. As part of a team from Carleton University Robotics Club, I participated in the 2012 competition."
