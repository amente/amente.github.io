experience: "I gained a bit of knowledge about the Android Platform and mobile app development by working on BubbleWrapFun."
motivation: "One day I read an article <a href='http://www.npr.org/blogs/krulwich/2012/12/06/166685434/what-to-do-when-the-bus-doesn-t-come-and-you-want-to-scream-an-experiment'>here</a> about a train company which managed to reduce customer complaints about waiting times by using an ingenious solution. The solution involved providing customers with different sizes of bubble wraps to pop while they are waiting for their ride to arrive.  This simple psychological solution worked perfect, and in addition had a proved extra benefit of reliefing stress that arises from waiting. After reading the suggestion in the same article which mentioned few bubble wrap apps , I decided to try them. My experience was rather dissapointing, all of them had tons of adds and some had unsatisfying user interface. None of them felt something that I can happily open when I am stressed waiting for my bus or train to arrive.So I decided to try develop my own. And the project BubbleWrapFun was born."

highlights: "I worked on this while I was teaching myself the Android Platform and API's, It is currently in its inception and will be published to the AppStore when it is nice and stable.All BubbleWrapFun code is open source and can be found on <a href='https://github.com/amente/BubbleWrapFun'>Github </a>."
