Addis Abeba Institute of Technology (AAiT) is a technology college for Addis Abeba University which is located in the capital city of Ethiopia,Addis Abeba. I was studying Electrical and Computer Engineering there before I moved to Canada and started a B.Eng in Computer Systems Engineering.While I was there, I was involved in setting up a club Amateur Radio station(ET3AA) with the most incredible man that I met in my life, Mr.May.
