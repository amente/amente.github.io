Google has a [nice tool](http://trends.google.com) that enables anyone to see the overall trend for any searched word over a certain period of time. Not only this , but it also allows to narrow results based on a given location. Just out of curiosity, I picked up 5 words and looked at search trends that originate from Ethiopia. You will be enthralled by the results !

N.B: The graphs just show a trend, by that I mean they show a normalized and scaled (0-100) number of searches for a given word (And related words) compared to the maximum number of searches for the same word over the period shown.In simple words ,They just show the interest in the topic not conclusively about the amount of traffic. For detailed explanation of how Google does this, look at the [help page.](http://support.google.com/trends?hl=en)

**1. Meles**

[![meles_trend](/images/uploads/2012/12/meles_trend.png)](http://amentebullo.wordpress.com/2012/12/30/looking-at-the-google-trends-from-ethiopia/meles_trend/)

If you look at the trend for "Meles" the name of the lately deceased prime minister. You should be able to notice the huge spike around September 2012(The month of his death). Even if they you didn't hear the news (Which is of course not practical under any circumstances)  you could guess something odd has happened just by looking at the trend. Witness the power of data (Huge data) and Google, take a bite :) The other words that I picked are even more interesting.

**2. Facebook**

The growth of Facebook in the last 5 or 6 years has been phenomenal, reaching 1 billion active users worldwide in 2012. Looking at the search trend for the word "Facebook' , in Ethiopia, you can learn the same thing. Of course this graph doesn't say anything about the amount of traffic, but in general you can see the increase in the interest .

**3. Education**

This trend is rather very odd. Every now and then you see these spikes where the interest suddenly increases and then decreases only lasting very short. If you look up closely (Much better if you look at the trend on Goolge it self) , you will notice that those spikes are periodic having about a year gap between two tips. And interestingly enough, the spikes occur around September and October and these months are the beginning of a school term in Ethiopia. I think the search trend amazingly correlates with the reality. But why is there a decline in interest for the rest of the year? I have looked at the same trend for other countries and there is nothing similar. You make your own conclusions. I will move on to the next one, and it gets even more interesting.

**4. Gun**

Are Ethiopians becoming more interested in knowing about guns? Do they need them? Why? The interest just popped up around mid 2010 as you can see.

**5. Computer**

This trend is not interesting in the same way as the others above , but rather in a very peculiar way. One thing that makes it different arises from the way Goolge breaks the search trends in to specific cities. And here only two cities appear , "Addis Abeba" and "Shashemene" . The most interesting fact here is , the traffic for the search of the word "Computer" is more from Shashemene than Addis Abeba the capital. You barely see Shashemene in other trends and here it just comes up. People from Shashemene are more interested in Computers than those in Addis Ababa. Take another bite :) :)

Even though internet penetration in Ethiopia is the lowest in the world, such trends can be observed and they actually make sense. I had fun time playing with it. You also take a look.Thanks for reading this.
