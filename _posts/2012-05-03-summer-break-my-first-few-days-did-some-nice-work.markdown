It has been a while since my last post, a lot of new updates, I finished school for this year. Well that's not a lot, but for me actually it is. Now I can concentrate on my own schedule and do the things that I planned to do as I exactly want them to be done. At this time there is a lot going in my mind. For the first 4 days of my four month summer , I was working on a Website for IEEE Carleton University Student Branch.Yes,I am the Web Master for the club.I tried to put up  a simple navigable attractive web site. And I came up with this [www.ieee.carleton.ca](http://www.ieee.carleton.ca) . That was fairly good, because, of the four days I spent working on this, I wasted  two of them to come up with something I looked back and said ,'Well that's ugly! '. So I abandoned my work and started all over again. To give you some tips, The Web Site is based on WordPress. If you don't know what WordPress is then I wonder how you got here. Anyways, WordPress is a Content Management System(CMS) for website building (Don't confuse it with the cloud service that powers this blog wordpress.com, which it self is powered by WordPress). I have had few web sites built with it before. WordPress is tailored for making blogs, not websites, but as you might find out with few seconds of googling, it powers 16% of the top one million wesites. It is easy to customize WordPress to build a rich powerful website leveraging its thousands of plug-ins and themes. And that is exactly what I did to build the Carleton IEEE Student Branch WebSite, the web site is not new and It has been using wordpress for a while, I just had to make it better to compete in the annual Student Branch Web Site Contest. Fingers crossed it will win first place.

Let me explain the work I did. Well first thing is first, I was not alone when I worked on this, We did it as a team with few of my friends. Of course me as the web master planning what is to be done. Ya, a Team is the most important thing that you need to have , if you will be working on a project. No kidding! Ask your elders or seniors whatever!  Next thing, yes, I planned all the work that I need to do ahead of time, usually , I am not used to doing that, but now I see it is very important. I wrote a master plan document that explains all the work that needs to be done, and included some checklists and tasks. It really payed off.

Now, more details, I have already mentioned that I wasted the first two days, let me explain how. OK here is how it goes, first I chose a simple theme , with no important features , just plain layout and decided to customize it by adding page templates and fiddling with the layout and style css files. That sounds not bad, but actually it is, especially when you want it be done with in 4 days. So I made the page templates, installed and configured the plugins, added some script to the header.php and footer.php files and well by the time I am done with all this and looked at it , well you have read what I felt, It was ugly! There was a lot of work to be done. Well then I learned a lesson, by lesson I mean I learned what not to do! That is usually what you will learn if you are teaching yourself or are learning by yourself. So  I said, 'Ok, If I can get this theme customized to my needs this much then why not start with a better one, which is very close to my needs and add more features to it, and fine tune it'. And that turned out to be a good decision.

I started with a nice team based on HTML5 and jQuery. I customized the header and footer as I wanted it to be. I added some more page templates. It has most of them done as I want it already. Then ya, I concentrated on the eye-candy stuff, added some more JavaScript, even customized some of my plug-ins. Walla!, work completed, I like what I did now. I have plans to make the web site even better. Add more functionality. And If we win the competition then I will like it even more.

Ok, Summary, you probably didn't read all the stuff above this, you might be just skimming through what I wrote, so I will help you get the message anyways. While I was making a website for the Club  (IEEE Carleton University Student Branch) at my school, I learned a lesson that it is better to start with something that is well developed than spawn your own from nowhere.
