Being able to learn **how to learn**, is the skill that I see only very few students acquiring. The formal education, that I went through was, and is still, full of instructions,rules and dictation. It is a broad and general way of learning for an average student, and it is designed to make sure that every one learns at least something.This was very inefficient in a way that it limited my ability to learn new things at the expense of somebody else learning what I already know, with me. Even if I didn't know the topic that I am learning, it usually took some more time for some other students to understand it, limiting my productivity out of the time and resource (the teacher) that I had. I should also mention that there were times (Art and Music Classes) that I have wasted some other students time and resources because it took me sometime  to understand the topics and perform well. So a class based schooling is the best way to cancel out each students productivity based on the available resource, to come up with an average student.  I was not able to understand this,until I learned how to learn by myself.

When did I learn to learn by myself?  The answer for this is very clear when I get to see it from where I am standing now. It was when I started reading different books and topics that I never saw my teacher mentioning in the class. I started working on my text books way before I got to learn them in the classroom. It seems very difficult thing to do for most students, but I say it is not at all. I say any one who meets the prerequisites of a topic and who has the ability to learn it from the teacher in later time, can also learn it by himself in his own time. Although the time it would take might vary from student to student depending how much they know about the subject matter initially and also based on the level of their analytic skills, but there is a general way  how this works.

When I read up on a topic that I have no idea at all, there is feedback loop that goes back and forth, forcing me to infer on to my previous knowledge and at the same time pushing me to learn the bits and pieces of the new topic independently on their own right. It is like looking up to a dictionary for a meaning and finding a word that I don't know in the meaning, forcing me to look for the meaning of this new word and understand what it means to infer back to the first word and know its meaning.

This feed back loop becomes explicitly clear for example, when learning to write a computer program with an imperative language. The coding process goes in a loop where you write the program, debug it, get the error messages, find out what they are , fix your code, and debug it again, and keep doing this until you get a working program that does exactly what you are looking for. This loop is self supported so you don't need any instruction or dictation from a second party. You can always improve up on your work from the feed back you get from your own work.

In fact it happens that the necessity for tests,assignments and exams at school is to give feedback to the students    about their improvement, but this process is very slow and is even sometimes affecting the student's productivity in a negative way.

I found this topic very interesting but, I have to wrap up things and publish it so that it won't end up with most of my many other posts in the unfinished draft folder. In another post in the future, I will write more about my experience as learning to learn by myself, and also explain the idea in a broader sense.
