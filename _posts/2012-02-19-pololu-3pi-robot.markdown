It has been a while since I started playing with my [3pi robot](http://www.pololu.com/catalog/product/975) .So now is the time to write a blog post about it. 3pi is high-performance mobile platform robot  with two micro metal gearmotors, five reflectance sensors, an 8×2 character LCD, a buzzer, and three user pushbuttons, all connected to a C-programmable ATmega328P micro controller. Depending on which vendor you are getting it from it costs about $70-$100.

Descriptions of 3pi robot, Courtesy of www.pololu.com

The robot is an entry level, easy to learn and inexpensive starting tool for learning robotics. Resources are available from [Pololu](http://pololu.com) including a complete guide with example projects.

The robot is designed to performs activities like line following and maze solving.The Atmega328P micro controller and the open ended design gives it the flexibility to extend it by adding other sensors. The two micro metal gearmotors are very fast and can be driven about 1m/sec. The five reflectance  sensors are positioned so as to make it easier to line up and detect a 3/4 inch black tape.

For those readers with knowledge of electronics,here is a simplified schematics of the robot from www.pololu.com:

The design of the robot is based on Arduino families, therefore it can be programmed using the [Arduino ](http://arduino.com)environment and library. But the best way to program it is using [Atmel's AVR Studio](http://atmel.com).

Based on my experiment with this robot,I have obtained the following skills so far:

Broadened my knowledge of reflectance sensors, how they work and how to use them.

Increased my knowledge and understanding of micro controllers.

Learned about ISP programming and programmers. I have started building the USBtiny after accidentally buying the kit from [adafruit](http://adafruit.com).

I will be taking part in a 3pi competition organized by the robotics club at my university.

Here are some pictures of my robot:

There are also some you tube videos from my channel, from Carleton Robotics Club and also other people. Enjoy them and Thank you for reading this.
