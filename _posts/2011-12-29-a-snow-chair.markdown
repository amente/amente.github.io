Today I made my first snow structure, a chair,with my brothers and sisters.The idea was to make a snow man named 'Blizzard', which we planned a day before. But,the snow was not sticky enough to roll a ball to make Blizzard's body. So, instead of making 'Blizzard' we made just a snow chair,Poor 'Blizzard'! . Playing with a frozen snow is not that fun,your hands get really cold, but for a person like me who has never done this before, it was worth it.
