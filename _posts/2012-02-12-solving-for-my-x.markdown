A few minutes just before I wrote this post, I stumbled across [http://www.wesolveforx.com/](http://www.wesolveforx.com/) .  It is a forum that is just launched (few hours ago) by Google. The idea is this:

_'Let us define x. x is a solution.A solution to a seemingly insurmountable problem.Like climate change or cancer, one that affects the world.But what if we redefine x as a challenge and opportunity for radical thinking. A chance to light up the world with break through ideas and cutting edge technologies. The stuff of science fiction.The just like fly after all. Solving for x requires wonder and imagination, and a vision to build seemingly impossible solutions to the worlds biggest problems.Solve for x! **Moonshot thinking**_! '

After watching some  videos of the speakers from the opening ceremony.It led me to ask the question '**What is my x?** '.

My '**x**' is complicated. It is hidden under complex social systems. It is a big sub set of the 'x' of the world, if not equal to. For me, solving for the 'x'  in the elementary and high school mathematics books was very trivial. But this one appears to need a lot of effort and commitment plus of course, moonshot thinking. All which I am currently working on. I know that solution is not always guaranteed.I also know that it can not come, working only by myself. More importantly I know that the solution need not be an invention.

Here are some videos from [http://www.wesolveforx.com/](http://www.wesolveforx.com/) .
