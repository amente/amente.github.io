Back in April when l first heard about the RaspberryPI , I was so excited , I couldn't even stop thinking about it. But after a while, knowing that it would be almost impossible to get my hands on it soon enough, my interest waned a little bit. Or did it? I don't think so, I am even super excited now. and had it delivered few weeks ago.

The Raspberry Pi, as I quote it from [its makers](http://www.raspberrypi.org) word by word, is a credit-card sized computer that plugs into your TV (Screen)  and a keyboard. It’s a capable little PC which can be used for many of the things that your desktop PC does, like spreadsheets, word-processing and medium games. It also plays high-definition video. The makers want to see it being used by kids all over the world to learn computer programming, and I think they are right. It's unbelievably cheap cost of just $25 for a basic version and $35 for the one that has Ethernet connection makes it really interesting.

This tiny computer is based on the ARM 11 is able to  run Linux distributions like Debian Squeeze and  Arch Linux OS. The vast possibilities of its applications to Embedded Systems and Robotics like those of  [Arduino](http://arduino.cc) and [Beaglebone](http://beaglebone.org)  to cheap personal computers make me wonder how far this will go. People are coming up with [amazing projects](http://raspberrypi.org) already.

I have just recently started playing with it and I will see what I can come up with. I have also more technical posts coming up. Stay tuned!
