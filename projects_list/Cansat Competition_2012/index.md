The <a href='http://www.cansatcompetition.com/Main.html'>CanSat Competition </a> is organized annually
by the American Aeronautics and Astronautics Society with featuring sponsors
such as NASA and brings university teams from all over the world to participate by designing,
building and launching a can sized satellite like system.
As part of a team from Carleton University Robotics Club, I participated in the 2012 competition."

I worked on tasks that involved low level embedded applications programming in C/C++ and
high level desktop application in Java. The CanSat competition project enabled me to learn a lot of things , including inter chip communication protocols,
Microcontroller programming and systems architecture.

The project also enabled me to closely work with
and learn from students who are studying Mechanical and
Aerospace Engineering ,Electrical Engineering and Software Engineering.
