AlertBuddy is my capstone project at Carleton University. I worked with four of my friends 
to design and implement a wearable emergecy alerting device for the hearing impaired.

The main objectives were:

- To detect and recognize emergecy alarm sounds.
- To alert the user using haptic and visula feedback

The wearable system was divided into four major subsystems: siren detection algorithm, wrist device hardware, wrist device firmware and mobile application. 
I mainly worked on the research and development of the siren detection algorithm.

The following poster shows the highlights of the technique:
